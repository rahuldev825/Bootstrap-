Ans->	Bootstrap is a popular front-end development framework that is used to design responsive and mobile-first web pages.
	Some of the key advantages of using Bootstrap include:
	1.Consistency: 
	-> Bootstrap provides a consistent set of design elements and styles that can be applied across an entire website or application, ensuring a cohesive and professional look and feel.

	2.Responsive design: 
	-> Bootstrap is designed to be responsive, meaning that it automatically adjusts the layout and content of a web page based on the size of the screen it is being viewed on.
	-> This makes it easy to create websites that work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

	3.Time-saving: 
	-> Bootstrap includes a large number of pre-built components, such as navigation bars, forms, and buttons, that can be easily customized and integrated into a website or application.
	-> This can save a significant amount of development time compared to building these components from scratch.

2.What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?
Ans->	-> In Bootstrap, a container is a basic layout element used to contain and align content within a web page.
	-> The container element is used to create a fixed-width container for content, with a responsive layout that adjusts to the width of the device or screen it is being viewed on.
	-> There are two types of containers in Bootstrap: .container and .container-fluid. 
	-> The .container class creates a fixed-width container that is centered on the page,
	   while the .container-fluid class creates a full-width container that spans the entire width of the viewport.

	-> Here's how a Bootstrap container works:
		1. A container is created using the .container or .container-fluid class.
		2. The container element has a fixed max-width value, set to either 1140px (for .container) or 100% (for .container-fluid).
		3. Inside the container, rows and columns are used to create a responsive layout that adjusts to the screen width.
		4. Rows are used to contain columns, and columns are used to organize and align content within the row.
		5. Columns have a flexible width that adjusts to the size of the screen, based on a 12-column grid system.
		6. By default, columns have equal width, but they can be customized using responsive classes such as .col-sm, .col-md, and .col-lg.

	-> Overall, Bootstrap containers provide a simple and effective way to create responsive layouts and organize content within a web page.
	-> By using the built-in classes and grid system, developers can create a consistent and professional-looking design that works well on a wide range of devices and screen sizes.

3.What are the default Bootstrap text settings? 
Ans->	In Bootstrap, there are several default text settings that apply to all text elements on a web page, unless overridden by custom CSS styles.
	These default text settings include:
	1.Font family: 
	-> The default font family used in Bootstrap is "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif. 
	-> This font family provides a clean and modern look that is easy to read on a wide range of devices and screen sizes.

	2.Font size:
	-> The default font size for body text in Bootstrap is 16px.
	-> Heading elements, such as <h1> and <h2>, have larger font sizes by default, with the size decreasing for each subsequent heading level.

	3.Line height:
	-> The default line height for body text in Bootstrap is 1.5.
	-> This provides a comfortable amount of space between lines of text, making it easier to read and scan content.

	4.Text color: 
	-> By default, text in Bootstrap is black (#000000).
	-> However, there are several text classes that can be used to change the color of text.
	
	5.Text alignment:
	-> The default text alignment for body text in Bootstrap is left-aligned. 
	-> However, there are several text classes that can be used to change the alignment of text, such as .text-center, .text-right, and .text-justify.

	Overall, these default text settings in Bootstrap are designed to provide a clean and consistent look and feel for text elements on a web page.
	By using the built-in text classes and styles, developers can create a professional-looking design that is easy to read and navigate.

4.What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?
Ans->	The Bootstrap Grid System is a flexible and responsive layout system that allows developers to create a grid-based layout for their web pages.
	The grid system is based on a 12-column layout, which can be customized to create a wide range of different layouts for different screen sizes.
	Here are some key features of the Bootstrap Grid System:
	1.Responsive design:
	-> The Bootstrap Grid System is designed to be responsive, meaning it can adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
	-> The grid system uses media queries and CSS classes to adjust the layout based on the screen size.

	2.12-column layout: 
	-> The Bootstrap Grid System is based on a 12-column layout, which allows developers to easily create a variety of different column configurations. 
	-> Columns can be combined to create rows, which can then be used to organize and structure content on a web page.

	3.Container and row classes:
	-> To use the Bootstrap Grid System, developers first create a container element using either the .container or .container-fluid class.
	-> Inside the container, rows are created using the .row class.
	-> Columns are then added to the rows using the .col-* classes, where the asterisk represents a number from 1 to 12. 
	-> The .col-* classes determine the width of each column, with 12 columns filling the width of the container.

	4.Offset and nesting:
	-> In addition to the basic column classes, Bootstrap also provides classes for offsetting columns (.offset-*) and nesting columns within other columns (.row inside .col-*).

	By using the Bootstrap Grid System, developers can create a responsive and flexible layout for their web pages that works well on a wide range of devices and screen sizes.
	The grid system provides a simple and intuitive way to structure content and organize elements on a page, while still allowing for customization and flexibility.
